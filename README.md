## Hi there 👋  

I'm **Natalia Monroy**, an LLM researcher and developer, fascinated by how we can make AI more accurate, reliable, and useful. My work focuses on developing and evaluating LLM applications, especially tackling challenges like hallucinations.  

### 🔍 A Few Things About Me:  
- 🧠 Deeply interested in **consciousness and phenomenology**
- 🐆 Animal lover, with a special admiration for **cats and jaguars** (big or small, they're all majestic).  
- 🎮 Huge fan of **horror video games**, especially the psychological kind—**Silent Hill 2** and **SOMA** hold a special place in my heart.  
- 📊 I enjoy diving into **LLM metrics and evaluation**, ensuring AI responses make sense in both technical and human terms.  
- 📖 I love to read and I'm drawn to stories that explore **existence, identity, and the nature of intelligence**, whether through AI, philosophy, or cosmic horror.  

⚡ **Fun fact:** If I could live in any fictional universe, it would probably be one where we finally **understand what happens when we go through black holes**—or one resembling the ending of *Asimov’s The Last Question*, where humanity merges with a supercomputer to solve the ultimate mysteries of existence.  

Let’s connect and build something cool! 🚀
